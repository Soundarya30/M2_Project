# Introduction
## Solar Panel Position By Tracking Sun


A solar panel is a device that absorbs the sun's rays and converts them into electricity. This energy can be used as needed or as a straight replacement for grid-supplied electricity. Solar panels should absorb as much energy as possible in order to make the most efficient use of solar energy. This is only possible if the panels are always pointing in the direction of the Sun. As a result, solar panels should rotate towards the direction of the sun to absorb more energy from it. This project is about a circuit that rotates a solar panel in response to the sun's location.
